Support: Forward questions regarding support to om@petkar.ca
Roadmap: 
- Allow the user to pick a specific time for the reminder instead of the number of seconds/minutes into the future
- Allow the user to schedule and manage multiple reminders
- Allow the user to toggle a setting which makes it so the reminder plays a sound even when the user's phone is asleep
